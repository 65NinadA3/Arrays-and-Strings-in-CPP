## Overview

Arrays and strings are fundamental concepts in C++ programming used to store collections of data. An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations, which allows efficient access using indices. Strings, on the other hand, are arrays of characters used to represent text.

This program demonstrates the use of arrays by taking input of multiple numbers, storing them in an array, and then displaying the stored values.

## Algorithm

1. Declare an integer array of fixed size (7 elements).
2. Prompt the user to enter 7 numbers.
3. Use a `for` loop to take input and store each number in the array.
4. Use another `for` loop to iterate through the array.
5. Display each number stored in the array.
6. End the program.
